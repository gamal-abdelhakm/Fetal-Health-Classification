# Fetal-Health-Classification

The Fetal Health Prediction model is a machine learning model that uses various techniques to classify the health of a fetus and is deployed as a web application using the Streamlit framework. This model can be used by medical professionals to identify potential health issues in the fetus early on and take appropriate action to prevent child and maternal mortality. It can also be used to monitor the health of the fetus throughout pregnancy and provide personalized care to the expectant mother.
